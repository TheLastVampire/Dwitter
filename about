Please find below the details of your project, viz. Dwitter:

We want you to make Dwitter, which was what Twitter is, before Twitter was Twitter.

Using Django, make a RESTful API, which allows the dweeter to:
- View all the dweets from followed folks
- Add new dweets
- Like someone’s dweet
- Comment on the dweet
- Search and follow new dweeters
- Search dweets
- Create new account (Auth)

Conditions:
- You can use any 3rd party libraries.
- There should not be duplicate data entries in the database, eg: dweets.
- Push your code to GitHub and share the URL with us. Please be sure to not mention “Draup” in your repository to avoid leaking answers.

Please share the repository link with us. We do a plagiarism check on your answers so please make sure the code is not copied.

You will also be evaluated on organization of the code and code quality.

Please note that the due date for this assignment is March 24 (Sunday). Feel free to revert in case of any clarification.

Wish you all the best!
